### Directory structure
- assets - holds the picture files (sounds...)
- src
  - objects - holds self contained objects such as player, enemies, treasure (in this example only the player is a self contained object)
  - states - the game is split into several states that helps us control it easier. Each state can call another state if the condition is right.
    - boot - in charge of any configuration that should be configured before the game is started. calls 'load' when done.
    - load - loads the assets (pictures/sounds) into memory. calls 'menu' when done.
    - menu - displays the start menu. calls 'play' when the player presses "w".
    - play - in charge of the game play itself. calls 'win' and 'lose' according to specific conditions.
    - lose - handle losing the game
    - win - handle winning the game
  - game.js - game manager with helper methods
  - app.js - loads all the states and initializes the 'boot' state
